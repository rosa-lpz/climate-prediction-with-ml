# Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to explore the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (outcome). The goal of simple linear regression is to model this relationship by fitting a straight line (the regression line) through the data points, which best represents the relationship between the variables.


# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a set of independent variables and a binary dependent variable, where the outcome is typically coded as 0 or 1 (e.g., no/yes, false/true). Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous outcome, logistic regression predicts the probability of a particular class or event occurring.

The logistic regression model uses the logistic function to transform the linear combination of the independent variables into a probability that ranges between 0 and 1. This makes it particularly useful for classification problems, such as determining whether a customer will make a purchase, if a patient has a certain disease, or if a student will pass a course.
